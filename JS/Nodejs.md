Environment to run javascript outside a browser

### What can I create with Nodejs?

Pretty much anything a scripting and server language like python or ruby can, but with JavaScript
- Tooling (build, automation, etc)
- API's (REST, Realtime, etc)
- CDNs
- Shareable libraries
- Desktop applications
- Pretty much anything because node is on everything now
