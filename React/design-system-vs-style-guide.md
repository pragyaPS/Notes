A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

Most design systems are really just pattern libraries: a big box of UI lego pieces that can be assembled together in near infinite ways. All the pieces may be consistent, but that dosent mean the assembled result will be.
### Your product is more than just a pile of reusable UI elements. It has a structure and a meaning. It's not a generic web page. It is the embodiment of a system of concept.
 
Design systems are always evolving, and the way you share and encourage adoption of new iterations will evolve along the way as well.

Design system
Rules constraint principle
Accessibilety: foreground, background, border

uppercase for button
voice and tone 
interrelated independent components
Typography
Styles need to be documented
SHare What a y behind the sites
Not make for one audience., Clear and consistant naming convention
Have documentation
Learn themselves without bugging everybody
Solving the problems So that engineers should be working on real problem not like whats the color of problem
Building a library of design patterns , rules and UX guidelines prevent inconsitencies when shipping products at scale.


As the number of devices, browsers, and environments continues to increse at a staggering rate, the need to create thoughtful, deliberate interface design system is becoming more apparent than ever.
