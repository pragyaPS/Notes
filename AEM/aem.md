Adobe Experience Manager is a web-based client-server system for building, managing and deploying commercial websites and related services. It combines a number of infrastructure-level and application-level functions into a single integrated package.


At the infrastructure level AEM provides the following:
Web Application Server : AEM can be deployed in standalone mode (it includes an integrated Jetty web server) or as a web application within a third-party application server.
Web Application Framework : AEM incorporates the Sling Web Application Framework that simplifies the writing of RESTful, content-oriented web applications.
Content Repository : AEM includes a Java Content Repository (JCR), a type of hierarchical database designed specifically for unstructured and semi-structured data. The repository stores not only the user-facing content but also all code, templates and internal data used by the application.
Building on this base, AEM also offers a number of application-level features for the management of:
Websites
Mobile Applications
Digital Publications
Forms
Digital Assets
Communities
Online Commerce
